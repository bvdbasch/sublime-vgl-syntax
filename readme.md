#Sublime Text 3 VGL syntax highlighter
This is a **work in progress!** Currently some highlighting is faulty and some of Sublime's built in features like block/line commenting do not work.

However, this highlighter does show highlighting for *most* of the common keywords and functions and the highlighting works with all the different color schemes.

##To do
- Rewrite scopes to ensure proper highlighting
- Fix comments not working properly
- Extend highlighter with code snippets
